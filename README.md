In our project, we present a data mining approach to detect heartbeat anomalies using electrocardiogram (ECG) images. By digitizing paper ECG records and applying various image processing techniques, we transform the images into 1D signals. These signals are then used for feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification using machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and voting-based ensemble classifiers. Our model aims to diagnose cardiac diseases, including myocardial infarction, abnormal heartbeat, and normal cardiac function, based on ECG reports. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, leading to the development of a robust and efficient tool for automated diagnosis and analysis of cardiovascular conditions.

Our project's approach begins with preprocessing ECG images to extract essential features like P, QRS, and T waves, followed by transforming them into normalized 1D signals. These signals are then combined and analyzed using various supervised classification algorithms to predict the presence of cardiac anomalies. Additionally, we employ dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance model interpretability and efficiency. Through extensive experimentation and validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach in accurately diagnosing heart conditions, thereby offering a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in clinical settings and contributing to improved patient care and outcomes.
